# SentinelAI Recruiter Notes

## One Sentence Summary
System that transforms raw logs into dense embeddings and uses a lightweight LLM reasoning layer to produce clear incident explanations.

## What This Project Shows
• Ability to design retrieval augmented systems  
• Practical FAISS integration for semantic search  
• Backend engineering with FastAPI  
• Structured prompt design and LLM reasoning workflows  
• End to end data flow from ingestion to final explanation  
• Security domain problem solving using AI

## Resume Ready Points
• Built a security focused retrieval assistant that parses logs, generates embeddings, and performs semantic search with FAISS.  
• Implemented a reasoning layer that explains incidents and recommends remediation steps.  
• Designed a clean API and simple UI to demonstrate complete end to end functionality.

## Good Interview Topics
• Embedding selection and indexing strategy  
• Latency and performance tradeoffs in vector search  
• Evaluating retrieval quality  
• Hardening the system for production
